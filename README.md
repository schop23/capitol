# Capitol

## Description
This was a project by fellow General Assembly students for their UX/UI final project. They designed an improved website for Capitol.  They recruited me to put their design to life through HTML and CSS. 

## Brief Example
This is a photo of the website as they designed it. I was tasked with replicating that as close as I could.

## List of Technologies
I used HTML and CSS in this project. I used the picture that they sent me and created something as close to that as I possibly could in the time allowed.
